/*
 * What version this is, read from the manifest rather than written twice.
 *
 * A literal in the source is a literal that drifts, and a `--version` that
 * lies is worse than no `--version` at all.
 *
 * Found by walking up from this module rather than by a fixed relative path,
 * because the depth differs: `src/version.ts` in this checkout and
 * `dist/version.js` in an install, and neither should have to know which it
 * is. `package.json` is always at the package root and npm always ships it,
 * so the first one above this file is the right one - which in a workspace is
 * this package's rather than the repository's.
